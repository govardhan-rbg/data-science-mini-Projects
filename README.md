# data-science-mini-Projects
Includes machine learning  , Deep Learning ,  Natural Language Projects

## Horse_Human_Regonition 
used convolutional Neural Network To recognise human and horse pictures . 
Model Has acheived an accuracy of 98.5% on training set and 89.1% on validation set

## Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
In this project , I used various Classification algorithms . 
This dataset contains numerical values which are a result of PCA transformations. 
This PCA transformation is done because data is secured and not sharable. 
Model has acheived an accuracy of 99.95%


## Food_Vision_Projrct

Made 3 models using transfer learning by importing EfficientNetB0 model from Keras.applications api .
In model 1 data is used without any data augumentation layer and achieved an accuracy of 70.45%.
In model 2 data augumentation is used and achieved an accuracy of 65.60%.
Model 3 is made by fine tuning model 2 and achieved an accuracy of 71.27%.
All the results of the 3 models are stored and viewed on tensorboard using callback.
