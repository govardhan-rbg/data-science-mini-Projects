Includes machine learning  , Deep Learning ,  Natural Language Projects

## Horse_Human_Regonition 
used convolutional Neural Network To recognise human and horse pictures . 
Model Has acheived an accuracy of 98.5% on training set and 89.1% on validation set

## Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
In this project , I used various Classification algorithms . 
This dataset contains numerical values which are a result of PCA transformations. 
This PCA transformation is done because data is secured and not sharable. 
Model has acheived an accuracy of 99.95%
